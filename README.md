# Be stars with detected X-ray emission

**Advisor: Oleg Kargaltsev**

Be stars are rapidly rotating B-class stars with strong stellar winds that produce distinct optical emission lines. Their rotational velocities are approaching their breakup limit and they possess equatorial decretion disks. Be stars are also interesting because they are often found in high mass X-ray and Î³-ray binaries. However, the end products of Be star (and Be binary system) evolution are not fully understood, and it is possible that because of their fast rotation and large mass Be stars may be progenitors of certain types of compact objects. For these reasons, Be star systems that emit in the X-rays are particularly interesting candidates for study.
